# COVID-19 Detection using Chest X-Ray
COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, underscores the importance of early detection and prompt treatment to reduce fatality rates. The standard diagnostic method, the RT-PCR test, while accurate, can be expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, our system leverages chest x-rays to detect COVID-19, offering a more accessible and rapid solution.

Using deep learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm that analyzes chest x-rays to determine the presence of COVID-19. Patients can upload their chest x-rays to our platform, and our algorithm will assess whether they are infected. Research indicates that chest x-rays can be more effective than RT-PCR tests, providing reliable, practical, and swift results. By combining clinical symptoms with chest x-ray analysis, our approach offers a faster and more straightforward method for examining suspected COVID-19 patients.

Our study is based on extensive data from patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 and whose chest x-rays confirm the infection. Our algorithm has been trained on numerous x-ray images of both COVID-19 positive and negative cases. When a patient uploads their x-ray to our platform, the algorithm identifies patterns and accurately determines the infection status.
